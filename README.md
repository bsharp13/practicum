# practicum
Hey everyone, my name is Braden Sharp, and for this practicum I developed two applications based on machine learning models that predict whether specific patients will miss their medical appointments. There's a lot going on here between the stored model objects, appendix code that doesn't contribute to the final products, the apps themselves, etc., so the most important code is identified below.

Machine Learning Pipeline:
EDA
-> Schedule_ModFit_AlgorithmSelection
-> Schedule_ModFit_Tuning

Applications:
Schedule_App.py
-> Calendar_App.py

* This is my first time trying anthing like this in Python. Please show mercy
